# DSA Patterns ‚Äì Daily Practice for Mastery 

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) pattern-based learning repository. This is my daily space for **solidifying core concepts**, building **problem-solving intuition**, and maintaining **consistent practice** in preparation for coding interviews at top tech companies.

---

## Purpose of This Repo

This repository is my personal commitment to:

- Strengthen my understanding of key DSA patterns
- Reinforce concepts through deliberate daily practice
- Maintain a clean record of problems I've solved
- Build consistency toward long-term mastery 

This is **not just for revision**, but also a **learning-through-doing** space.

## Each Problem Includes

- Problem link (LeetCode)
- Identified pattern
- Brute , Better and optimal solutions
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Related variations (if any)

---

## Daily Commitment

I‚Äôm solving and pushing problems **daily** to:

- Maintain momentum
- Track learning over time
- Identify gaps in my understanding

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3
- IDE: Leetcode Platform / Jupyter Notebooks (sometimes for visual aid)/ Google Colab
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## Why Pattern-Based?

Studying DSA by patterns (instead of randomly solving problems) helps me:

- Quickly recognize problem types in interviews
- Apply reusable templates
- Master both brute force and optimized approaches

---

## Goals

- Build deep understanding of common interview patterns
- Solve 200+ quality problems with clear explanations
- Stay consistent daily until interview readiness
- Crack interviews at product-based and top-tier companies
